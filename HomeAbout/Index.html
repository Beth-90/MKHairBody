    <h1>About</h1>

    <p> Hi! My name is McKenzie.<br>
        Welcome to MK Hair & Body!<br><br>
        I am located inside Krismatic Salon and Spa at 100 E Broadway in downtown Eugene, <br>
        just up the block from Saturday Market. I specalize in hair and body wellness,<br>
        and strive to bring the best quality care to my clients. My passion for hair and<br>
        body wellness began long before attending beauty school in San Diego at Bellas Academy, <br>
        Throughout my life I have studies ingredients and learned the ins and outs of hair and<br>
        skin care. And now I want to put my skills to work for you.
        <br><br>

        Why Me?<br>
        The ever evolving beauty industry keeps me on my toes with my education. I am constantly<br>
        learning and growing. This means that I am advancing my skills every day to assure my<br>
        my clients I am dedicated to quality client experiance. I pride myself on honesty and<br>
        and my integral approach to my craft, and I will never make promises I cannot keep.<br>
        But above all my goal is to help you meet your Hair and skin goals. And have a lot of <br>
        fun in the process!
        <br><br>

        On a more personal note...<br>
        My personal life very much ties in with my work life. I have twins, a 9 year old and I am <br>
        married to a wonderful man. My family has inspired me to go for my dreams and have <br>
        supported me every step of the way. When I am not at work, my free spirt is out in <br>
        nature, dreaming about road trips, at home doing mom things or studying for my<br>
        business degree.<br><br>

        Thank you for taking the time to get toknow me and I hope to meet and work with you soon!
